# Bird Audio Classification Project in Bosque Protector La Prosperina
The Bird Audio Classification project in Bosque Protector La Prosperina is an exciting initiative that harnesses the power of advanced technologies like TensorFlow, Keras, and Variational Autoencoders (VAE) to analyze and classify bird sounds in the pristine environment of Bosque Protector La Prosperina.

# Project Overview
This project involves the following key steps:

Audio Recording Collection: Bird sounds are recorded in the Bosque Protector La Prosperina using xeno-canto datasets.

Audio Preprocessing: The recorded audio data is transformed into spectrograms. A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies in a sound or other signal as they vary with time. This transformation is crucial as it converts the audio data into a format that is more suitable for analysis using machine learning models.

Training with Variational Autoencoders (VAE): The spectrograms are then used to train a Variational Autoencoder. The VAE is a type of neural network that learns a latent space representation of the input data. This latent space can capture the underlying patterns and features of the bird sounds, making it easier to classify and analyze them.

Latent Space Representation: The VAE creates a compact, meaningful representation of the spectrograms in the latent space. This representation is then used for further analysis and classification tasks.

Classification and Analysis: The latent space representations are fed into PCA components algorithm to identify and classify the bird species present in the recordings.

# Technologies Used
TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning framework used to build and train the neural networks.
Keras: A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow.
Variational Autoencoders (VAE): A type of neural network that provides a probabilistic manner for describing an observation in some latent space.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): A class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery, which in this project, helps in classifying the spectrograms.

# Goals and Impact
By leveraging the expertise of machine learning and audio processing, this project aims to:

Contribute to Avian Biodiversity Research: Enhance our understanding of the avian biodiversity within the Bosque Protector La Prosperina.
Promote Conservation Efforts: Provide valuable data that can aid in the conservation and protection of bird species in the forest.
Advance Technological Applications: Demonstrate the effectiveness of advanced machine learning techniques in ecological and environmental research.
